1. From stackoverflow
First of all, on_exit isn't specified by POSIX (atexit with the same semantics is). Second , the linux manual says:

    The on_exit() function registers the given function to be called at normal process termination, whether via exit(3) or via return from the program's main().

Getting killed by a signal is not a normal exit for a process so callbacks installed with on_exit and atexit aren't implicitly called.
